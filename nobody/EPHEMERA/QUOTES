RE: TWILIGHT LANGUAGE

"The other aspect of assertion that bears on deflationism is that of how we
get to understand what people do as the making of assertion in the first
place. It is one thing to make noises or to scratch inscriptions, but
another thing for those noises or inscriptions to be rightly interpretable
as vehicles of thought or belief. There need to be practices of 
interpretation that are familiar to the agent and the audience, or
conventions to which they are parties. Just as a piece of paper must be 
embedded in an established social practice in order to count as a banknote,
so an inscription or noise must be similarly entrenched to be a vehicle of
thought and belief. And just as the value of a note may changeas the economy
shifts, so the meaning to be attached to a noise or an inscription can 
change as social practice changes. This is not the place to explore the
whole subject of linguistics, but it is important to bear in mind that the
amazing complexities of thought and belief that language enables do not come
from nowhere. The interpretation of any language is a skill that needed to 
be learned, in one's early years if it is the mother tongue, or with more 
pain and effort if it is not." --Simon Blackburn "On Truth"

"Language is a virus from Outer Space." --William S. Burroughs
