"She's jumped again."
"You mean she's dead."
"Yes. If the Entity follows its previous patterns it will remain in 
Bardo for a bit before reincarnating."
"Six months still?"
[Magic 8-ball quote]
"Have any of the precogs figured out where yet?"
"No."
"Keep the teeps on stuff and inform me when something changes."
And with that he hung up the phone and stared into the crib at his 
first born son.

A picture: The father brings the infant scion out of the bedroom
and raises it high over his head; grandmother in her walker clapping. 

Mother is dead.

FOR GM EYES ONLY: 

OVERVIEW 
This college-prepratory academy is located on a California 
coastline cliff somewhere between San Luis Obispo and San Francisco.
It was founded 100 years ago in 1878. It is secluded and well 
guarded. 

The students are told that school property ends at the nearby brush
line on the southern side and steep rocky mountains to the north. 
They are told that the school is only about 40 square acres in size
and that the area surrounding it is owned by the State Parks agency
and an oil refinery and they must stay off those areas or risk 
expulsion. In fact, the Academy is several times bigger and owns
hundreds of acres surrounding the school's complex of buildings.

There is a small airport at the small city that is 30 miles up the
freeway. The freeway is a 20 minute drive from the school's gates. 
It's secluded here. It's meant to be. 

BUILDINGS & STAFF 
The architecture and buildings of the main campus are of the ivy &
brick style. There are lots of cement urns and statues of previous
administration and faculty. Most prominently the School's founder
