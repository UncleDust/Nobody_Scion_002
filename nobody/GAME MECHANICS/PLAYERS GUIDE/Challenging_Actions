CHALLENGING ACTIONS	

file created: 01.01.2019

ACTIONS are behaviors a Character can do in the game. 

When the player announces an action, if it is of a simple nature (i.e. 
something that most people can easily do) then they simply do it. Examples
of simple actions are opening a door, going up some stairs, opening an 
unlocked box, etc. 

Other actions are of varying levels of difficulty and will require the
player to use a chosen SKILL and/or a PLAYER CHARACTER ATTRIBUTE to 
determine whether or not they succeed at more challenging actions.
