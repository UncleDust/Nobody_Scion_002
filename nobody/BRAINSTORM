Might there be a girl (a la "Fountainhead") running between 
the Nobody and the Scion? 

The referee the fairy godmother archetype? 

There are visits/encounters with archetypes; cantebury tales, alice
in wonderland, gullivers travels, tarot

The player must be engaged and challenged on the psycho-emotional 
levels and not just the maudlin reflexive. The player must undergo 
catharsis and radical, personal transformation in order for there to
be a profound artistic experience. Anything less than this is diversion
and pandering and childish wish-fulfilment.

Although you can choose either character...here take this test to
see which one you would prefer. 1) maybe just one super important 
question after the generic description of the nursery and crib. The
answer determines nobody or scion and what the rest of that
module will be like.

Incorporate chose your own adventure into literature.

And pop-up book?

Illustrations

When "Supramundanes" are alone (outside the range of any Mundane's sense 
perception) they are able to execute their powers with visuals and
increased (more powerful, increased range, number, speed, etc.) effects.
